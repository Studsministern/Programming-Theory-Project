# Character creation prototype

Project created with Unity 2020.03

This project was created [as a submission](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/submission-programming-theory-in-action?uv=2022.3&labelRequired=true&pathwayId=5f7e17e1edbc2a5ec21a20af&missionId=5f779f1eedbc2a00201f3e5e#) in the chapter about applying object-oriented principles in the [Unity Junior Programmer pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer). The purpose of this project was to learn about and utilize the four fundamentals of object-oriented programming:

- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation

## Features

The project is made up of a prototype character creation screen with customizable name, gender, race, class and alignment. Upon creating the character, a player character game object is created with the player's corresponding choices. It also features classes for creating different characters, as well as classes for handling stats and stat modifiers, for implementation and further development in other projects.
